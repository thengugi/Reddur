								<p>Tarik is tribal punk dub influenced act (Matrilineal punk(?)) from Shillong whose musical content is an eccentric blend of punk and radical themes with a Khasi twist. While their riffs are catchy, their lyrics are far from sugar coated. Strongly rooted in a DIY philosophy, the members of Tarik are proud of their uncompromisingly honest approach to music because it best captures the spirit of the space they come from. While descriptions by mainstream media have ranged from: grotesque, gutsy, rare gems, vulgar and edgy, to ridiculously profound, Tarik goes largely unaccredited (quite happily) for pioneering the advocacy of radical politics in the largely derivative music scene of Shillong.
								Tarik has garnered a dedicated cult following in Shillong and elsewhere.
								</p>

								<p>  Tarik’s debut album titled Folktales from the Parking lot and Foreign Monoliths (Khanatang Parking lot bad ki mawbynna dewbilat) is a testimony to their musical genius. A 9 track debut album recorded at red dur studios and engineered by Tirthankar Ray of Bluemonk Inc. Studios is undoubtedly a landmark in the musical scene in India. As observed by the Telegraph, the bi-lingual album is a “gritty melee of thought-provoking melodies" sung in English and Khasi, with catchy bass tunes and heart-pounding Khasi beats”
